But I say to you, everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed
adultery with her in his heart.
      Matthew 5:28
%
Avoid immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the
immoral person sins against his own body. Do you not know that your body is a
temple of the holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and that you are
not your own? For you have been purchased at a price. Therefore glorify God in
your body.
      1 Corinthians 6:18-20
%
This is the will of god, your holiness: that you refrain from immorality, that
each of you know how to acquire a wife for himself in holiness and honor, not
in lustful passion as do the Gentiles who do not know God; not to take
advantage of or exploit a brother in this matter, for the Lord is an avenger in
all these things, as we told you before and solemnly affirmed.
      1 Thessalonians 4:3-6
%
For all that is in the world, sensual lust, enticement for the eyes, and a
pretentious life, is not from the Father but is from the world.
      1 John 2:16
%
Let us conduct ourselves properly as in the day, not in orgies and drunkenness,
not in promiscuity and licentiousness, not in rivalry and jealousy.
      Romans 13:13

Avert my eyes from what is worthless;
  by your way give me life.
      Psalm 119:37

Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just,
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any
excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.
      Phillippians 4:8
%
Let marriage be honored among all and the marriage bed be kept undefiled, for
God will judge the immoral and adulterers.
      Hebrews 13:4
%
She wins him over by repeated urging,
  with her smooth lips she leads him astray.
He follows her impulsively,
  like an ox that goes to slaughter;
Like a stag that bounds toward the net,
  till an arrow pierces its liver;
Like a bird that rushes into a snare,
  unaware that his life is at stake.
So now, children, listen to me,
  be attentive to the words of my mouth!
Do not let your heart turn to her ways,
  do not go astray in her paths;
For many are those she has struck down dead,
  numerous, those she has slain.
Her house is a highway to Sheol,
  leading down into the chambers of death.
      Proverbs 7:21-27
%
No trial has come to you but what is human. God is faithful and will not let
you be tried beyond your strength; but with the trial he will also provide a
way out, so that you may be able to bear it.
      1 Corinthians 10:13
%
But he bestows a greater grace; therefore, it says:
  "God resists the proud,
   but gives grace to the humble."
So submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  Draw
near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and
purify your hearts, you of two minds. Begin to lament, to mourn, to weep. Let
your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection.  Humble
yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.

Do not speak evil of one another, brothers. Whoever speaks evil of a brother or
judges his brother speaks evil of the law and judges the law. If you judge the
law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
      James 4:6-11
%
Take no part in the fruitless works of darkness; rather expose them, for it is
shameful even to mention the things done by them in secret.
      Ephesians 5:11-12
%
For the time that has passed is sufficient for doing what the Gentiles like to
do: living in debauchery, evil desires, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and
wanton idolatry.
      1 Peter 4:3
%
Chastity, or cleanness of heart, holds a glorious and distinguished place among
the virtues, because she, alone, enables man to see God; hence Truth itself
said, "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God."
      St. Augustine
%
Chastity is a difficult, long term matter; one must wait patiently for it to
bear fruit, for the happines of loving kindness which it must bring. But at the
same time, chastity is the sure way to happiness.
      St. John Paul II
%
Love is very respectful of people. It does not use people. And namely, love is
chaste.  And to you all, young people, in this hedonist world, in this world
where there are only commercials, pleasure ... I tell you: Be chaste! Be
chaste! It is right to try for a genuine love, that knows to give life, that
does not search to use the other for its own pleasure. A love that makes sacred
the life of the other person: "I respect you, I do not want to use you." It is
not easy, we all know the difficulty to overcome this easy and hedonistic
conception of love. Make the labor to live love chastely.
      Pope Francis

The world will offer you comfort, but you were not made for comfort. You were
made for greatness.
      Pope Benedict XVI

Don't let your life be sterile. Be useful. Blaze a trail. Shine forth with the
light of your faith and of your love. With your apostolic life wipe out the
slimy and filthy mark left by the impure sowers of hatred. And light up all the
ways of the earth with the fire of Christ that you carry in your heart.
      St. Josemaria Escriva

What does it matter that you have to curtail your activity for the moment, if
later, like a spring which has been compressed, you'll advance much farther
than you ever dreamed?
      St. Josemaria Escriva

Virtues are formed by prayer. Prayer preserves temperance. Prayer suppresses
anger. Prayer prevents emotions of pride and envy. Prayer draws into the soul
the Holy Spirit, and raises man to Heaven.

Pain is never permanent.

Occupy your mind with good thoughts, or the enemy will fill them with bad ones.
      St. Thomas More
%
Man cannot live without love. He remains a being that is incomprehensible for
himself; his life is meaningless, if love is not revealed to him, if he does
not encounter love, if he does not experience it and make it his own, if he
does not participate intimately in it. This is why Jesus Christ reveals man to
Himself.
      St. John Paul II
%
The opposite of love is not hate, but use.
God never created his children to use one another.
      St. John Paul II
%
We are not the sum of our weaknesses and failures. We are the sum of the
Father's love for us and the real capacity to become the image of his Son!
      St. John Paul II

He who wishes to find Jesus should seek him, not in the delights and pleasures
of the world, but in mortification of the senses.
      St. Alphonsus Maria de Liguori

Satisfaction consists in the cutting off of the causes of the sin. Thus,
fasting is the proper antidote to lust.
      St. Richard of Chichester
%
There is no remedy so powerful against the heat of concupiscence as the
remembrance of our Savior's Passion. In all my difficulties I never found
anything so efficacious as the wounds of Christ: In them I sleep secure;
from them I derive new life.
      St. Augustine

There is a need for a crusade of manliness and purity to counteract and nullify
the savage work of those who think man is a beast. And that crusade is your work.
      St. Josemaria Escriva
%
A man who governs his passions is master of the world. We must either command
them, or be enslaved by them. It is better to be a hammer than an anvil.
      St. Dominic

He who does not overcome his predominant passion is in great danger of being lost.
He who does overcome it will easily conquer all the rest.

Every stone that makes you stumble
  And cuts you when you fall
Every serpent here that strikes your heel
  To curse you when your crawl
The King of Love, one day, will crush them all.

And so, consider this from generation to generation,
  that none who hope in Heaven shall fail in strength.
Do not fear the words of sinners,
  for their glory ends in corruption and worms.
